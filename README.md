# JASMIN Help site

This repo houses the source for the JASMIN Docs site, implemented using the [Hinode](https://gethinode.com) template for the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator. There are a number of ways such a site can be deployed: check with Matt P for current details.

Documentation on how to edit & update the website will follow in due course.

For any issues with content or functionality of the site, please open an issue in this repo.
