This article introduces the project specific servers. It covers:

## What is a project-specific server?

Previously, projects could be provided with dedicated servers
built with specific software required by the project, or where
access needs to be restricted to members of a project or institution.

## Get Access

On the JASMIN accounts portal, you can apply for access to an existing Project
VM.

Step 1: Select Project VMs from the Discover Services menu on the left
