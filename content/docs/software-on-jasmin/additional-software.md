This article provides details of additional packages that exist under the
`/apps/jasmin/` directory which is available on all scientific analysis
servers and on the LOTUS batch cluster on JASMIN.

The `/apps/jasmin/` directory has been provided as a home for additional
software packages that are not installed within either [Jaspy]({{% ref "jaspy-envs" %}})
or ["jasmin-sci"]({{% ref "jasmin-sci-software" %}}) environments.
This page details which packages are available along with details of how they
are managed and accessed.

## Community packages under: /apps/jasmin/

Software installed as _community packages_ are provided, and maintained, by
developers outside the CEDA/JASMIN Team. If you have queries about using
community packages on JASMIN then please contact the JASMIN Helpdesk and we
will forward them to the team that supports that specific package on JASMIN.

### ESMValTool

The Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool) is a community diagnostics
and performance metrics tool for the evaluation of Earth System Models (ESMs)
that allows for routine comparison of single or multiple models, either
against predecessor versions or against observations. See the
