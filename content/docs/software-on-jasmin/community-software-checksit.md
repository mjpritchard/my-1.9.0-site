## Overview

`checksit` is a tool that checks the structure and content of a file against a range of available checks. Checks can be made using either "spec" files defining rules that objects within a file must meet, or comparison against a template file.

Whilst initial development focussed around the standards developed for NCAS data, checksit can be adapted to check files against any desired requirements.

## Features

Currently, checksit can:

- use spec files and define rules against which to check files
- check a file against a given template file
- check for compliance against `NCAS-GENERAL-2.0.0` and `NCAS-IMAGE-1.0` standards
- output in either "standard" mode or a one line "compact" mode
- summarise output from multiple "compact" mode file checks

Work in progress includes:

- check for compliance against other NCAS standards (e.g. `NCAS-RADAR`)
- check against future versions of standards (`NCAS-GENERAL-2.1.0` and `NCAS-IMAGE-1.1`)
- allow user defined specs and rules
- Visit the GitHub repository linked at the bottom of this page for further information on what is being worked on.

## Use on JASMIN

`checksit` is available on all `sci` machines. To check a file in your current directory:
