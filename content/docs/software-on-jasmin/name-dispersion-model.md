This article provides links to information about running the Met Office
atmospheric dispersion model, NAME, on JASMIN.

## The NAME atmospheric dispersion model

The Met Office's Numerical Atmospheric-dispersion Modelling Environment (NAME)
<https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/modelling-systems/dispersion-model> can
be run on JASMIN using the LOTUS cluster. A NAME Group Workspace is
provided to store both the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) met data needed
to drive NAME as well as the user outputs derived from NAME itself.

This service has been developed through a collaboration between STFC CEDA, the
Met Office Atmospheric Dispersion and Air Quality team and the University of
Leicester.

If you would like to know more about running NAME on JASMIN, please contact us
at [atmospheric.dispersion@metoffice.gov.uk](mailto:atmospheric.dispersion@metoffice.gov.uk).
