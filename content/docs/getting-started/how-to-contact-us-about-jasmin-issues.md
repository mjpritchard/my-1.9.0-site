If you are experiencing difficulties or slow performance and are unsure why,
please first consult all relevant documentation, then if needed, contact our Helpdesk
using the help beacon below, but please include the following
information with your initial query:

- What is the full name of the JASMIN server you were using? ( e.g. `sci-vm-01.jasmin.ac.uk`)
- The full path of your current working directory e.g. `/gws/nopw/j04/mygws`
- Date & time that the issue occurred
- Your JASMIN account username
- Your description of the issue and copy/paste any error messages from the terminal
- Location of code/script used - if possible, so one of the CEDA/JASMIN team can reproduce the issue
- A batch job ID if it relates to LOTUS jobs

Please provide as much specific information as possible so that we can direct
your query to the appropriate staff and deal with your enquiry efficiently.
Hopefully, the time invested in solving your issue will also help other JASMIN
users now and in the future.
