This article explains how to register on the JASMIN accounts portal.

Having a JASMIN portal account does not by itself provide you with any access to JASMIN machines or services.

## JASMIN accounts portal

The [JASMIN accounts portal](https://accounts.jasmin.ac.uk/) is the place where you manage your JASMIN account and can apply for access to the many services which you may want to use on JASMIN.
