This article lists sources of information about the status of JASMIN services.

## CEDA Status page

The {{< link "ceda_status" >}}CEDA Status page{{< /link >}} is updated regularly to announce or track current and upcoming incidents which may affect JASMIN and CEDA services. Please check for known incidents or announced shceduled maintenance before contacting the helpdesk.

## JASMIN dashboard

The {{<link "https://mon.jasmin.ac.uk" >}}JASMIN metrics dashboard{{</link>}} has been redeveloped and is now available again. You can log in with the same username and password for the JASMIN Accounts Portal.

Please read the introductory information on that page.

Currrently it provides:
- GWS Dashboard
  - view of all the volumes in a group workspace across different storage types, showing quota and usage
- LOTUS Dashboard
  - showing pending and running jobs per partition (queue) and other useful metrics
- Power Dashboard
  - showing power consumption of the various components of JASMIN
- Tape dashboard
  - showing summary information on tape usage by consortium

This is still under active development and further dashboards may be added in due course.

Please also keep an eye on:
- `JASMIN-USERS` email list (all users should be on this list. If not, please ask)
- {{< link ceda_news >}}CEDA News{{< /link >}} articles on the CEDA website
