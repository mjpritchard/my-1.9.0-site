## Get a login account

A user with a `jasmin-login` grant is allocated a `HOME` directory of
**100GB** and can access the shared JASMIN servers (Scientific servers, data
transfer servers) and the LOTUS batch cluster. Sign in into the
{{<link "jasmin_accounts_portal">}}JASMIN accounts portal{{</link>}} where you can apply for a JASMIN login
account representing the JASMIN access role appropriate to your affiliation.

**Step 1:** Select Login services and navigate to the 'More information' on
this service

**Step 4:** Upon approval, a notification email is sent to you. Additionally,
a notification counter in the bell will appear on the top left corner of the
menu bar on your JASMIN account portal page. You have now access to the login
server and to the scientific servers

Under 'My Services' you can view all the services that you currently have
access to or have requested access for. Note: Every time a notification is
acknowledged the counter is reset or decremented.

Now you can proceed to [How to login]({{% ref "how-to-login" %}})
