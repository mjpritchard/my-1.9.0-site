{{<alert alert-type="danger">}}
JASMIN accounts created before February 2017 had to be migrated to use the
JASMIN accounts portal.
It is now no longer possible to do this migration automatically.

If you had a JAMIN account which you haven't used since before February 2017,
we might be able to help you reclaim it.
Please contact support@jasmin.ac.uk and if your account still exists we will
advise as to if you are able to reclaim it.
