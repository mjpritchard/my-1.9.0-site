## About this site

**We hope you like our new-look help docs** which make use of richer formatting to make the articles easier to read, particularly those with code snippets or command-line instructions. We've also changed the way we manage the source content so it's easier for us to maintain. There's still more to do, to re-organise some of the content and add new pages to reflect how JASMIN is evolving.
This site should redirect you from any previous URLs you may have stored, but please use the following features to help you navigate around the site:

- main navigation bar along the top of the site, including search tool
- breadcrumbs menu, to show you where you are in the site
- collapsible sidebar, left side panel (docs pages only)
- icons, to identify articles within the same section
- table of contents, right side panel
- hover over sub-headings to reveal a bookmark-able link to that heading
- {{< icon fas tag >}} {{<link url="/tags"  >}}tags{{</link>}} to group together articles covering similar topics
- links between articles

## Issues with this site

If you spot any broken links or incorrect information, please let us know by opening an issue in the GitHub repository for this site's source code:

{{<button icon="fab github" cue=false order="first" href="https://github.com/cedadev/jasmin-help-hugo-hinode/issues" >}}Report issues with this site{{</button>}}

The date of update date and commit message for each page should be just above the footer of each page.

## Other issues

For all other reports of problems, or for any information you can't find (don't forget the other JASMIN sites linked in the footer!), please use the contact form via "Ask" in the JASMIN Help beacon (bottom right, orange button) and use the contact form to send a message to the helpdesk: this is the best method to get in touch.
Note that the beacon no longer contains the links to the help docs themselves, but still provides the contact form. Hopefully the other navigation features described above should enable you to find what you need.
