This article highlights the essential principles of working with group
workspaces.

##  Keeping informed

Please maintain contact throughout the life of the GWS via the following
methods:

- Using the [JASMIN dashboard](https://mon.jasmin.ac.uk) to check on the status of your GWS (used versus available space).
- Using the {{<link "gws-scanner-ui">}}GWS Scanner User Interface{{</link>}} to check on where, for how long and by whom, space is being used.
- GWS Managers should {{<link "gws-scanner">}}configure the GWS Scanner{{</link>}} to gather the above information and arrange email alerts.
- Look out for emails from the CEDA/JASMIN team
- The {{<link "ceda_status">}}CEDA status{{</link>}} page and News articles on the {{<link "ceda_site">}}CEDA{{</link>}} or {{<link "jasmin_site">}}JASMIN{{</link>}} websites which may be used to post messages regarding system status or security.

If you are aware that a user who has access to your GWS leaves your project,
or, for whatever reason, no longer needs to be a member of the GWS, please let
the CEDA helpdesk know, as arrangements may need to be made to transfer the
ownership of files and/or directories to another member of the GWS (e.g. the
manager) to ensure continued access to the data.
