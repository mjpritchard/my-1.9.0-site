title: Apply for access to a GWS
---

This article explains how to apply for access to a GWS from the JASMIN account
portal.

**Step 1** : Sign in into your [JASMIN accounts
portal](https://accounts.jasmin.ac.uk/). Navigate to the JASMIN services tab
of the portal then select the group workspaces from "Discover services" menu.
You can search or browse a list of available GWSs. For example here the search
for GWS with name containing CEDA, resulted in two GWSs.

provide supporting information. In the following example, the GWS cedaproc was
selected.

**Step 4** : You will receive a notification of the outcome of your
application. For example, the request to join an existing GWS cedaproc was
granted and details of this service such as status and expiry date are
displayed below

decremented.

or have requested access for under 'My Services'
